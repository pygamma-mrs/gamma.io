# Welcome to PyGAMMA/GAMMA

**GAMMA** is a C++ library for the simulation of magnetic resonance (NMR, MRS) experiments. It provides a simple and intuitive means to construct simulation programs to suit researchers' individual needs. GAMMA is an acronym for a ** *G*eneral *A*pproach to *M*agnetic resonance *M*athematical *A*nalysis **.

**PyGamma** is a Python wrapper around GAMMA that makes almost all of GAMMA's API available via [Python](http://www.python.org/). PyGamma users can skip the C++ compile and link steps and can even run GAMMA commands interactively line-by-line.

Both PyGamma/GAMMA and  work on OS X, Linux, and Windows.
